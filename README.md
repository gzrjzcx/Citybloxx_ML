# Citybloxx_ML
This is a repository where is intended as a space for 'working documents' and will be updated regularly during the whole project for tracking the work progress. Additionally, it is also used to store codes and version control of this project.
  
This is the [usage](https://github.com/gzrjzcx/Citybloxx_ML/issues/1) of how to use the scripts to convert Markdown to Markup.

## Project Information
- Project title: 
	- [Self-adaptive Video Games for Autistic Kids using Unity Machine Learning Agents](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/hpcdis/Self-adaptive+Video+Games+for+Autistic+Kids+using+Unity+Machine+Learning+Agents)
- Student name:
	- Alex Zou
- EPCC supervisor name:
	- Charaka Palansuriya

- Project proposal:
	- Final proposal:
		- `Develop a complete game suitable for kids with ASD so that the game provide both dynamically adjusted suitable difficulty level and a sensory environment(e.g., colour, sounds and visual effects).`
	- [Initial proposal](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/hpcdis/Self-adaptive+Video+Games+for+Autistic+Kids+using+Unity+Machine+Learning+Agents):
		- Develop a simple prototype game.
		- Investigate how to use Unity's Machine Learning Agents.
		- Test the developed game in an IOS tablet.
	- Project Risk:
		- Time Limitation:
			- Not only the new programming language and game engine(i.e., Unity), but also the Machine Learning part I need to learn and experiment. Therefore it is possible to cannot finish it on time.
		- ML Part Failure:
			- There are various techniques to achieve dynamic adjustment with Machine learning, however, it is high likelihood for most of them to fail to learn the acquire knowledge and achieve our goals.
